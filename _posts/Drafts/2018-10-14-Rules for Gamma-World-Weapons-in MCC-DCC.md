# Notes

The following rules are based on my play testing of running Gamma World in MCC.  I want to make sure the feel and flavor of Gamma World's weapons is available to people who want it in MCC. 


# Weapons

## Blasters 

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius |Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |

### Mark V Blaster Pistol
This unusual weapon’s ray weakens the nuclear force binding the the nuclei of atoms. All things touched by the beam disintegrate cleanly without dust or odor. This creates light, intense heat, and very little noise, and leaves an impressive 10cm hole in the target. Even the air is affected, making the beam visible as a white, near instantaneous streak. 

### Mark VII Blaster Rifle

This is a larger more effective version of the Mark V that fits into the form factor of a rifle that weakens the nuclear force binding the the nuclei of atoms. All things touched by the beam disintegrate cleanly without dust or odor. This creates light, intense heat, and very little noise, and leaves an impressive 10cm hole in the target. Even the air is affected, making the beam visible as a white, near instantaneous streak. 

### Mark XII Blaster Pistol
The Mark XII Blaster is an experimental weapon built right before the great disaster  It is the favored weapon of the Knights of Genetic Purity. The Purists use this ultra-powerful beamed weapon to annihilate any visibly mutated human on sight or keep their armies of slaves in line. 

## Black Ray 

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |

{: .well .table .table-striped}

### Black Ray Pistol
The ultimate hand-held weapon, it is powered by a Chemical Energy Cell good for 4 shots. Fortunately, few Black Ray Pistols are available. They instantly kill an organic target not protected by a Force Field, but have no effect on inorganic or dead organic matter or on those inside a Force Field. 

This looks like a clear plastic gun stock holding a black crystal 1 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.  The crystal is charged if a black liquid smoke movement is seen within the crystal.  If there is no movement within the crystal, or the crystal is shattered, it needs to be replaced. 

### Black Ray Rifle
The ultimate hand-held weapon, it is powered by 2 Chemical Energy Cell good for 4 shots (total). Fortunately, very few Black Ray Rifles are available. They instantly kill an organic target not protected by a Force Field, but have no effect on inorganic or dead organic matter or on those inside a Force Field. 

This looks like a clear plastic rifle stock holding a black crystal 2 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.  The crystal is charged if a black liquid smoke movement is seen within the crystal.  If there is no movement within the crystal, or the crystal is shattered, it needs to be replaced. 

### Black Ray Cannon
This dangerous piece of 24th century direct fire field gun is similar to those usually found on Warbots. It causes instant death to living targets not protected by force field. It does no damage to inanimate (non-living) targets, or targets protected by a force field.

Awesomely lethal, it is almost never seen on a mobile platform, but rather as a fixed direct fire gun piece, usually supplied with Nuclear power and controlled by an automated system (cybernetic installation, think tank, etc...) or operated manually from a nearby bunker. In this configuration, the weapon has unlimited power available for firing. The black ray cannon is only very rarely seen as a field piece, mounted on a wheeled or anti-grav base that can be towed behind a vehicle. 

This looks like a black crystal 3 foot lozenge as the barrel.  Energy is channeled from the energy cell through the crystal.  The crystal is charged if a black liquid smoke movement is seen within the crystal.  If there is no movement within the crystal, or the crystal is shattered, it needs to be replaced. 


## Harmonic Disruptor

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Siege | Harmonic Disruptor    | 7 | - | 100 | N/A |See Rules |3xSolar| 10 | 1 | N/A | 100kg | priceless | 4 x Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

The Harmonic Disruptor is a highly fragile and ancient artifact. Less than 20 are known to exist, and many a skirmish has been fought to possess one. Unfortunately, these battles often end in the destruction of this rare and powerful relic.

The disruptor looks like a 5 meter tall cluster of violet crystals held in a PlastiSteel case with many glass covered dials and finger controls of various colors. When activated, it sends out waves of harmonious sonic vibrations that cause damage to everything within its 100 meter range.

All targets within the damage radius receive 4d6 points of damage until either the harmonic disruptor is disables, deactivated, turned off, or until the victim leaves the 100 meter radius. All items of glass, hard metal, pottery, hard plastic, and plaster within the radius take one point of structural damage per Action Turn. Once the item loses all its hit points, it shatters from the harmonic stresses, and becomes permanently useless. 


## Drone Weaver

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Drone Weaver    | 7 | - | 1/3 mile | | See Rules |1xSolar| N/A | N/A | N/A | 100kg | priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

There are two types of Drone Weavers known in existence.  The Sphere and the Strand.  The Strand looks like a multicolored bead on the end of a 3 foot long braided strand of spun crystal.  The Sphere is a small metal sphere, 10 centimeters in diameter, has a small control panel under a flush hatch. There is a 12-button keyboard and LED readout underneath the hatch. The Strand drones are controlled via Holo-controls via a qualified ID Bracelet.  The user specifies a trigger condition of elapsed time or motion detected (by size). He then specifies a traveling distance (0 to 500 meters) and direction. The drone weaver can lie dormant for decades without reducing its effectiveness. Once triggered, the drone rises 1 meter off the ground and floats away at a speed of 5 meters per round. When it has traveled its specified distance, it begins to wander randomly and broadcast subsonic sound waves. These cause all creatures within range to make a MS check at -3. Those that fail must flee until they can no longer hear the noise. The subsonic can be heard up to 100 meters away. 


## Flying Blades

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | 
| Range | Flying Blades    | 7 | 5 | 165|N/A | 1d8 |1xSolar or 1xC| N/A | 1 | N/A | 100kg | 750 Ð | 600 |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This strange weapon is designed to distract and injure opponents while causing minimal harm to their equipment. It looks like a thick, circular saw blade. It has a single recessed switch in the center of one side that activates it. The reverse side has a covered socket for a power cell. Thrown like a Frisbee toward the target, the flying blade begins spinning at a high speed and flies on at 20 meters per round, searching for living heat sources. It is able to distinguish the intense heat of an engine from the lower level heat of a living creature. It moves straight ahead for 10 rounds searching for targets. If it doesn't find one, it falls to the ground, drained of energy. The initial to-hit roll is only used to determine if it is thrown in the general direction desired by the character.

Once it has locked onto a target, it splits into three separate blades, each attacking with +6 to-hit, doing 1d8 points of damage with each pass. Each blade can make one pass per round. After five rounds of fighting, the blades fall to the ground. Only chemical or solar power cells can be used in this device. 

## Lamprey Disk

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

{: .well .table .table-striped}

This is a metal disk about the size of a normal human hand. One side is strongly magnetized and will adhere to any steel surface with a strength of 8. A switch on the same surface turns the disk on or off. The switch is not accessible when the disk is stuck on a surface. When turned on, the disk absorbs magnetic and electrical fields within 3 feet. It can drain a chemical power cell in one round, a hydrogen cell in 10 rounds, and an atomic power cell in 20 minutes. Quantum cells are drained of all stored energy but will build up a charge when removed from the Lamprey field.  Any powered equipment affected by the disk, including robots, operates at half power. Weapons do half damage, robots and vehicles move at half speed, robots get half as many attacks per round, etc.


## Neural Bite

| Type   | Name               | TL  | Comp| Range | Radius | Dmg            | Power    | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost      | Value |

{: .well .table .table-striped}

There are two weapons with the name Neural Bite.  The first one is an actual whip with poison.  The second one is a ranged version of this weapon that was inspired by the Neural Bite wip.

Mark I: The neural bite looks much like an ordinary whip, but the last 20 centimeters (8") of this 3-meter-long lash bristle with small metal barbs. The barbs are unable to penetrate armor that provides an AC of 5 or less. If the barbs do penetrate, a nerve drug is injected into the opponent, dramatically altering his nervous system. This potent substance, intensity 18, acts like a paralytic poison, but results of paralyzed or worse means loss of free will (this drug cannot kill). The result is a mindless slave, who follows any orders he or she is given. The drug is injected into the neural bite with a syringe through a small rubber aperture, ringed in red, near the hilt. The weapon can hold up to eight doses at once.

Mark II: This looks like a silver metal ring, 1 foot in diameter, and bears a variety of multicolored beads along its perimeter.  When activated, it oscillates in the air and flies at its target using its base range.  Each turn it may attack a different target that is within melee range with a spark of energy that ignores the effects of armor and force fields.  The victim must make a save (Will Power) or call under the domination of the Neural Bite's controller.  

## Popper Pellet

| Type   | Name            | TL  | Comp| Range       | Radius | Dmg            | Power    | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost      | Value |
| :----: | :------------:  | :-: | :-: | :-:         | :----: | :-:            | :------: | :-:  | :---------:  | :-:   | :-:    | :-:       | :-:   |  
| Range  | Popper Pellet   | 6   | 3   | Thrown      |        | See Below      | N/A      | 1    | 1            | N/A   | 5g     | 250 Ð     | 25    |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

The popper pellet is an ocher kernel about the size of a large marble. To activate the item, the user throws it into an activated force field. Once it makes contact with a force field of any kind (excluding Mutational Force Fields), the popper pellet instantly gains the necessary power it needs from the field. Once attached, the popper pellet cloaks itself from IR, UV, and visible light, making it invisible to most individuals and sensors. It travels to the highest point of the force field (above the head for most powered armors and above the turret for tanks or robots).

While attached, the popper pellet lessens the effectiveness of the force field by five points (needed for the popper pellet’s own operations). If five points are not available, the popper pellet is unable to attach itself, and falls to the ground deactivated. The popper pellet also deactivates and falls if the force field drops for any reason.

When a popper pellet is thrown at a force field, the individual sees the popper pellet suddenly disappear as it comes into contact with the force field. In response, the force field generator beeps and blinks a warning stating the field strength has been reduced. 


## Smart Dart

| Type   | Name            | TL  | Comp| Range       | Radius | Dmg            | Power    | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost      | Value |
| :----: | :------------:  | :-: | :-: | :-:         | :----: | :-:            | :------: | :-:  | :---------:  | :-:   | :-:    | :-:       | :-:  |  
| Range  | Smart Dart      | 6   | 6   | Thrown + 40 |   30'  | 3d6 Electrical | Chemical | 1    | 1            | N/A   | 1kg    | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This looks like a double-sized flint arrowhead with iridescent edges.  When activated or flung at a target it homes in on the targets form and aura.  The victim must make a Reflex save each turn to avoid the dart, but the dart continues to attack the target until it strikes something.  When it hits it erupts in a flashing ball of electricity, harming all within 30 feet. 

Once the Smart Dart is discharged it falls to the ground needing to be recharged again.  It will take plug into a standard chemical battery and recharge over the span of 1 hour.  It can only hold 1 charge at a time.

## Slither Helix

| Type   | Name            | TL  | Comp| Range | Radius | Dmg | Power   | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost      | Value |
| :----: | :------------:  | :-: | :-: | :-:   | :----: | :-: | :-:     | :-:  | :---------:  | :-:   | :-:    | :-:       | :-:  |  
| Range | Slither Helix | 6 | 6 | Thrown + 30 | | 1d3 Progressive +1d | 1xSolar | 1 | 1 | N/A | 1kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This looks like a rainbow-colored ribbon 10' long.  When activated it animates and slithers after its target, attacking with its energized touch.  If struck a victim may make a REF Save to avoid being wrapped up in the Helix.  The victim takes progressive damage (save vs. Fortitude) each each turn it misses the Fortitude save.  The Slither Helix has 25 hit points.  It can only be harmed by physical damage.

## Stinger Crystal

| Type   | Name            | TL  | Comp| Range | Radius | Dmg | Power   | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost      | Value |
| :----: | :------------:  | :-: | :-: | :-:   | :----: | :-: | :-:     | :-:  | :---------:  | :-:   | :-:    | :-:       | :-:  |  
| Range  | Stinger Crystal | 7   | 6   | 30    |        | 1d6 | 1xSolar | 1    | 1            | N/A   | 1kg    | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

Stinger Crystal  This diamond shaped arrow is multicolored. when activated it springs into the air, hovering and spinning at the users shoulder.  It can be used either to strike a foe with a melee attack or block a physical or energy attack.  When blocking, the Crystal has 50 hit points.


## Trek Bomb

| Type   | Name              | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

{: .well .table .table-striped}


A 25-centimeter square black plastic box weighing 25 kilograms. Disintegrates everything within 60 meters not protected by a Force Field. Does 30 points of damage to characters protected by Force Fields (that may be absorbed by the field if it is strong enough). After detonation, the ground surrounding the Trek Bomb’s former location is disintregrated as well, leaving a perfectly symmetrical 2--'' crater. 


## Trek Gun

| Type   | Name             | TL| Comp| Range    | Radius | Dmg | Power | Ammo | Rate of Fire | Speed | Weight | Cost | Value |

| Range | Trek Gun | 6 | 8 | 650 | | See Below | 1xNuclear | 5 | 1 | N/A | 225kg | Priceless | Rank |
{: .well .table .table-striped}

This gun releases a concentrated blast of antimatter the same as a Trek Bomb. Any target not protected by a force field is disintegrated. Any force field hit takes 30 points of damage. This weapon is usually seen on Death Machines. Occasionally, this weapon was also mounted on tanks or on a mobile base as a field piece. It is also sometimes seen in a stationary emplacement, connected to a Nuclear Power Plant and controlled by a Cybernetic Installation or Think Tank. In this configuration it has unlimited power for continuous firing.


## Weapons that are Vehicles

### Warbot

This vaguely turtle-shaped unit is 9 meters long by 6 meters wide by 3 meters tall. It has 4 Micro-missile Launchers, 6 Torc Grenade Launchers (500 meter range and 5d20 Torc Grenades), 4 Black Ray Guns (200 meter range), 8 Mark VII Blaster Batteries of 3 guns each, 1 Matter Bomb Launcher 1200 meter range and 6d6 Matter Bombs) and 6 Laser Batteries of 5 guns each (1500-meter range and 15d6 damage per battery). All Warbots have a 200 Hit Point Energy Screen. They can use all weapons simultaneously.

### Think Tank

Usually building-sized units, Think Tanks have only one purpose - to plan for all possible contingencies and answer questions about the information they correlate. They were located only in very high-security areas such as space ports, secret military bases etc. Each is defended by its own permanent cybernetic installation regardless of the existence of another such installation which runs the base on which the think tank is located. Persons with Stage IV and V I.D.’s can communicate with (not control) a think tank, as can supervisory borgs and permanent cybernetic installations.

Each Think Tank was individually designed and built, so no two are exactly alike. In general, they were powered by 2 or more nuclear power plants, including backup systems. In practice, most of them will still operate limited to one power plant. Think Tanks depend on the organic “brains” that power the bulk of their cognitive abilities. If the Think Tank is totally without power for any amount of time, these “brains” will die and the Think Tank will be rendered useless. In many cases, still-functioning Think Tanks have developed severe personality quirks and some are outright insane due to lack of regular maintenance or spare parts (i.e. new “brains”).

### Death Machines

This 15 meter long, 9 meter wide, 3 meter high killing machine is covered with knobby projections housing sensors and weapons. Its main weapons are 2 Blaster Cannons that do 25d6 damage at a 1500 meter range. For close defense it has 6 Black Ray Guns with a 300-meter range. 4 Trek Guns that do the same damage as Trek Bombs and have a range of 180 meters, and 16 Mark VII Blaster Batteries of 4 guns each. These weapons can all fire at the same time. Other weapons include 8 Laser Batteries 15 guns each) that do 20d6 damage per Battery at a 1500 meter range and can fire simultaneously, 6 Mini-missile Launchers with 5d20 missiles fired individually and a Fusion Bomb Launcher with 5d10 Fusion Bombs. Both the missiles and the Fusion Bombs have a 3000 meter range. An Energy Damping Field fuses the circuits of Robots coming within 60 meters of the Death Machine and does 200 points of damage to all Energy Screens except its own within that range. The Death Machine's own Energy Screen can take 400 points of damage. Death Machines are very rare and will only be found near CI's that they are assigned to defend and from which they take orders. They almost always attack those who can't show Stage V I.D.


### AATAAV

The AATAAV is a gigantic, manlike war machine, standing 90 m tall and 36 m wide. The body is composed of energy-resistant CollaPlastic with a duralloy under-base. It must be piloted by a trained driver/gunner with a Stage V I.D.; the pilot controls all functions of the vehicle, including flight, hover, and walking capabilities, and all gunnery. Intensive training is necessary to operate the device at full efficiency, and such training is only available from certain military bases controlled by certain Cryptic Alliances.

The AATAAV has standard, infrared, and ultraviolet sensors effective out to 10 km, and has radar good out to 200 km. It can walk over light terrain at 25 kph, or use its hover thrusters to move over all terrain at twice that speed, for 120 minutes every 24-hour period (being limited by power and cooling considerations). For long-range travel, the AATAAV can reconfigure itself into a more aerodynamic form and fly normally, using anti-gravity pods and jet engines. The reconfiguration process takes only one minute, but during that time the machine’s weapons cannot be operated. In full flight con- figuration, the vehicle can reach speeds of up to 830 kph. Stream- lining is provided by shaping the force field around the vehicle. Because of the force field, no weapons can be used while the vehicle is in flight.

The AATAAV has a force-field energy screen capable of absorbing 300 points of damage. A high-intensity floodlight mounted on the vehicle’s head has a 1km range and projects a 30° cone-shaped beam. The floodlight will cause temporary blindness in most light-sensitive or nocturnal creatures within 300 m of the beam’s source.

Two smoke-screen projectors, mounted just below the visual sensors, are together capable of creating a cylindrical cloud of smoke or gas 30 m wide and 250 m long within 10 seconds. The smoke negates all laser attacks, ruins line-of-sight optical and infrared sensing, and can be mixed with a poison gas (intensity 3-18, as desired) useful against ground troops.

The AATAAV is heavily equipped and was intended for use as a shock force against massed troop concentrations. Two black-ray batteries, each holding six black-ray guns with a 600-m range, are mounted on the left and right hips of the vehicle. Each battery has a firing arc of 180° to its respective side. Each shin of the vehicle has a mortar, concealed internally but hanging out for firing. The left mortar is usually rigged for firing negation bombs, and the right one launches matter bombs (type beta). Each mortar has a 2-km range and may fire two bombs per action turn, with a supply of 40 bombs for the matter-bomb mortar and 80 for the negation-bomb mortar. The AATAAVs’ arms are each able to present a universal firing arc, quickly directing attacks in any direction. Each arm mounts three blaster cannon, doing 20d6 damage each at a 2km range. These guns are mounted around a massive central plasma-gun battery, with eight plasma guns per arm. The plasma weapons cannot be removed from the vehicle’s arms without destroying them. Because the plasma weapons use so much power, the AATAAV cannot do anything else while these weapons fire and must stand perfectly still. Finally, four standard Mark VII blasters rifles are mounted under the vehicle’s chin. These weapons have standard ranges and powers, and have a 90° firing arc to the AATAAV’s front.

The AATAAV is powered by a fusion power plant with a ten-year life span.The machine is rigged to automatically self-destruct (regardless of the pilot’s wishes) from a remote location, usually

A Military Installation. (This is an excellent way of keeping these devices out of the hands of the players.) However, the self-destruct mechanism and circuitry are considered secret knowledge, and no pilots are aware that these devices have been implanted in their vehicles. Because of the on-board guidance and fire-control systems, it is impossible for the pilot of a AATAAV to accidentally shoot his own vehicle in combat. An AATAAV will always remain upright unless it is depowered or purposefully made to sit down. Very few AATAAVs are in service, perhaps less than ten; only three to six of them would be in operation in North America. AATAAVs usually travel in small groups to provide fire support to one another.

### Aquabot

The Aquabot was designed to attack and destroy military installations along coasts or underwater. Twelve Aquabot were originally produced, and one industrial complex (location undisclosed) was designed to mass-produce them. It is a 3-man unit with 2 operators in the forward control room and one aft in the support fighter.

The Aquabot is equipped with an array of weapons systems. Four batteries of missile/torpedo tubes (6 in each shoulder, 2 in the chest) fire either underwater torpedoes (range 10km) or airborne missiles (range 200km). These are explosive, armor piercing Action Turns which cause 50d10 damage in a 300m radius. Each battery normally carries 50 missiles & 50 torpedoes. 2 Batteries of 7 rocket launchers are mounted in the units forearms. These rockets have a range of 100km (underwater) or 1,000km (air). Each causes 10d10 damage in a 150m radius. Each battery normally carries 150 rockets. Also mounted in each hand are 3 heavy beam cannons. Each cannon has a range of 2km (underwater) or 10km (air). These cannons cause 50d10 damage to structural targets or 10d10 to soft targets. Finally, the Aquabot carries 2 batteries of 4 light beam cannons. These have a range of 1km in any terrain. They cause 10d10 damage to structural targets or 5d10 versus soft targets.

Mounted in two hard-points on the units chest are defensive shield projectors which absorb 500 points of damage each, and can completely renew themselves every 20 minutes. These projectors are also linked to a defensive bubble system which allows the shields to envelope the unit underwater and allow it to move absolutely undetected by all known sensory equipment.

In the event that the unit suffers extreme damage, the control head functions as a detachable pod and may move away from the field of battle. The pod may only detach when all other systems have been destroyed. The pod may automatically detach if control personnel are incapacitated for any reason.

Docked at the tail of the Aquabot is an independently maneuverable support fighter for land-based warfare. When detached the support fighter mounts 8 small beam-cannons and has 100 Hit Points. It is equipped with a 50-point shield generator which renews itself every 40 minutes.
