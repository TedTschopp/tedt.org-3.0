# Notes

The following rules are what I have collected from around the Internet for the use of firearms in MCC & DCC.  I will be playtesting these by converting a Gamma World module to MCC. 


## Firearm Terms 


**Rate of Fire:** This is the number of shots an attacker may take for his action, up to the Rate of Fire.  However, each subsequent shot after the first shot decreases the die they use to roll their attacks by -1d. A firearm with multiple RoFs may fire once and only during the surprise round.  Automatic weapons are indicated by a number that indicates the number of rounds used followed by an 'A'.  A rate of fire that is expressed as a fraction like x/y means that the attacker may make x number of attacks before reloading for y uninterrupted rounds.  




## Firearm Rules


### Firearm Proficiency

First-time users decrease the die they use to roll their atacks by -1d to attacks with a firearm and they increase the fumble die by +1d. These penalties exists until either the character gains a level or appropriate training is acquired since first using the weapon.  Training will take a month where the character must spend 2 hours a day shooting his weapon.  This means a character must expend 2 hours x 60 minutes a hour x 7 days a week x 4 weeks a month = 3,360 rounds of ammunition.

### Reloading 

Black powder weapons can take up to 3 rounds to reload.  Reloading a firearm that takes cartridges manually can takes one action per round of ammunition.   If quick loaders or magazines are available, reloading takes one action per magazine.  Each magazine, quick loader, or box can be manually loaded with ammunition at the rate of one action per round of ammunition.  Machines can be built to load magazines faster in non-combat situations.

Ammunition that misses its target may not be retrieved to be reused.  Spent cartridges and bullets may be retrieved and reused by building their components.  However the fuel / explosive material in the cartridge is not reused. 

### Hits Do 1 Die of Damage

Each firearm has its own damage die.  For a standard attack, a hit does 1 die of damage. Damage is treated just like any other missile or melee attack, and can be healed as normal.

### Automatic Weapons

Weapons with a RoF that indicates an (A), instead of separate attacks, automatic weapons can affect multiple targets in a 10-foot square area. An automatic fire attack uses 10 rounds of ammunition. The attacker makes a single attack roll that’s compared to the AC of each target in the area. A hit causes 3 dice worth of damage, DC 10 Ref save for half. A critical hit on the to hit roll by the attacker (natural 20) does 6 dice of damage, DC 10 Ref save by the defender will save for for half of the damage rolled.

### Optional Fire arm rules

#### Dueling Proficiency 

Someone who is proficient in firearms may practice at becoming proficient at dueling.  A person may not benefit from these dueling rules until they become proficient in dueling.  In order to become proficient a character must use a firearm for two levels.  This may be reduced to one level with appropriate training is acquired since first using the weapon.  In order to train to be a dualist a character must spend at least 2 hours a day practicing for a full month.  This means a character must expend 2 hours x 60 minutes a hour x 7 days a week x 4 weeks a month = 3,360 rounds of ammunition.

Duels are deadly.  The two participants are standing still, facing each other.  The attack happens so quickly that dodging and maneuvering are not possible.  This means that duels are exceptionally damaging critical hits.  

Initiative is determined normally, with each weapon having their speed added to the result of the initiative.  This represents the duelists drawing their weapons.  The duelist with the highest initiative attacks first using normal to hit / attack rules.  If the attacker hits than the attacker rolls the weapons damage die a number of times equal to his level or number of hit dice.  If the target survives, he can attempt to shoot back, applying the same damage rules.  If the target does not survive, it is assumed he has fired back and the shot has missed.  If both duelists survive the dual, a normal combat round starts.  

**Weapon Speed:** Weapon Speed is an attribute of every firearm and it is only a factor for individual initiative rolls during duels.

#### Firearms Are Fast

Using a firearm gives a +1 Die for initiative. This represents how quickly a gun can be fired.

#### Aiming

As an action, the shooter may take time to aim. This will increase the attack roll by +1d and hits will increase the damage by +1d.  A character may aim round after round, but this bonuses does not accumulate from round to round.   

#### Surprise Attacks

Firearm attacks during a surprise round, or the target is otherwise unaware of the attack, will increase the chance of a critical hit by +2.   This bonus is in addition to bonuses from aiming and the initiative bonus inherent to using firearms.  Automatic weapons do not get this bonus.

#### Taking Cover

Taking cover is key to surviving a gun fight. If a target is actively hiding behind hard cover, no attacks can be made. If the target is firing back from behind some hard cover, the cover provides a+4 to AC. Firing from a firing port, murder hole or arrow slit can provide up to+8 points of AC.

### Fumble Table

| Roll | Effect | Rules |
| -:| - |:-
| 1 | Your shot misses everything by a good ten yards. | There are no rules for you, you lucky bastard! |
| 2 <br> Black-powder Firearms: | You are in such a hurry that you leave your ramrod in the firearm. | There is a 50% chance that the ramrod skewers your target, doing +2d6 additional damage, or does 2d6 damage to a randomly determined adjacent combatant (even an ally). The firearm cannot be reloaded until you get another ramrod.
| 2 <br> All other Firearms: | The bullet ricochets wildly off multiple surfaces in the environment -- trees, cavern walls, dungeon walls, the ground. | Everyone in the scene must make a DC 5 + your level Reflex save or take 1d4 damage, including you.
| 3 | The weapon alarms you almost as much as your target.| Make a DC10 Reflex save or drop the firearm.|
| 4 |The kickback from the firearm causes you to lose hold of the weapon. | You take a -2 to your next attack as you struggle to regain your grip.|
| 5 | A bad round explodes in the chamber! The firearm isn’t much use at the moment. | You can try to get it working again with about 10 minutes of effort spent towards repairs. |
| 6 |This round is a dud. | You lose your turn reloading the firearm or rotating the cylinder to remove the dud.|
|7|The kickback from the firearm sends the weapon flying. You drop it and are disarmed. | You must spend an action picking the firearm up again and another to rearm it. |
| 8 | The weapon fires a bit too close to your ear canal, making your ears ring loudly. | The next enemy that attacks you gets a +2 on his Attack Roll. |
| 9 | The firearm discharges smoke that burns your eyes. | You take a -4 to your next attack roll. |
| 10 | The bullet ricochets and hits an ally. | Roll damage for one randomly chosen ally. |
| 11 | You leave your finger on the trigger and discharge the firearm into the air before the attack. | Take 1d3 points of damage as a bird, squirrel, bat, or rock from the ceiling falls on your head. Roll a DC 13 Agility check or fall prone as well. |
| 12 | The weapon explodes in your hand. | You take 1d4 points of damage from powder burns and the weapon is rendered useless. It would take a gunsmith a week or so to fix it. Additionally, you are at -2 to Attack Rolls with the hand that was holding the weapon until you have healed. |
| 13 | You have difficulty maintaining hold of the weapon and it falls the ground. The fall causes the firearm to discharge and you take the brunt of the attack. | Roll damage. |
| 14+ |The firearm fails to discharge and you do what you should never ever do. You look down the barrel to see what happened. The firearm discharges after you shake the weapon with the weapon pointed straight at your face. | Roll under your current Luck score with a DC20 or take 30 points of damage. |
