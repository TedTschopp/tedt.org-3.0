#### Ancient dyke

>_“Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, two tall trees, larger than any trees of holly that Frodo had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they towered overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing deep night-shadows about their feet, standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.”_

Long overgrown, this ancient fortification still stands as an obstacle or a useful defensive feature.

#### Bog
>_“In a chill hour they came to the end of the water-course. The banks became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind.  On either side and in front wide fens and mires now lay, stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half-light. Mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools. The reek of them hung stifling in the still air. Far away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of Mordor loomed, like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea.”_

Deeper than simple mud, a bog – whether formed of marshy peat, a flooded river or torrential rain – presents a challenging battleground.

>_“Besides, at the end of a long night-march, and after bathing and drinking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at Bagshot Row was what he really wanted. An idea struck him and he turned to Gollum. Gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern.”_

>_“Now Turambar came to Nen Girith at sundown, and there he learned that Glaurung lay on the brink of the high shores of Teiglin, and was like to move when night fell. Then he called those tidings good; for the dragon lay at Cabed-en-Aras, where the river ran in a deep and narrow gorge that a hunted deer might overleap, and Turambar thought that he would seek no further, but would attempt to pass over the gorge. Therefore he purposed to creep down at dusk, and descend into the ravine under night, and cross over the wild water; and then to climb up the further cliff, and so come to the dragon beneath his guard.”_

#### Covered pit
>_“In the pits of Sauron Beren and Felagund lay, and all their companions were now dead; but Sauron purposed to keep Felagund to the last, for he perceived that he was a Noldo of great might and wisdom, and he deemed that in him lay the secret of their errand. But when the wolf came for Beren, Felagund put forth all his power, and burst his bonds; and he wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with his hands and teeth; yet he himself was wounded to the death.”_

A stone-lined cistern or subterranean room whose ceiling has collapsed, leaving a pit in the ground. The pit is invisible through a growth of foliage.  Creatures can hide in the covered pit. The pit provides total cover to creatures inside it. Once it has been uncovered, a shove action can be used to push adjacent creatures into the pit.

Falling into the covered pit inflicts falling damage for 20 feet, even if the pit isn't that deep and requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to climb out. | Falling into the covered pit inflicts falling damage for 20 feet, even if the pit isn't that deep and requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity check to climb out.
Falling: Falling causes 1d6 damage per 10’ fallen. For every damage die that comes up a 6, the victim breaks a bone. For each broken bone, the character permanently loses 1 point of Strength or Agility (player’s choice). The affected limb, rib, or vertebrae never heals quite right and affects the char- acter in some fashion from then on. | Falling: A fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6. The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.

#### Crags, rocky outcrops (defensible rocks),huge boulders

>_“For Manwë to whom all birds are dear, and to whom they bring news upon Taniquetil from Middle-earth, had sent forth the race of Eagles, commanding them to dwell in the crags of the North, and to keep watch upon Morgoth; for Manwë still had pity for the exiled Elves. And the Eagles brought news of much that passed in those days to the sad ears of Manwë. Now, even as Fingon bent his bow, there flew down from the high airs Thorondor, King of Eagles, mightiest of all birds that have ever been, whose outstretched wings spanned thirty fathoms; and staying Fingon's hand he took him up, and bore him to the face of the rock where Maedhros hung. But Fingon could not release the hell-wrought bond upon his wrist, nor sever it, nor draw it from the stone. Again therefore in his pain Maedhros begged that he would slay him; but Fingon cut off his hand above the wrist, and Thorondor bore them back to Mithrim.”_

Whether brought here by giants in ancient days, or simply the tip of a subterranean mountain, boulders and craggy outcrops can provide a vital advantage in combat by allowing creatures to hide among or behind them.

#### Dust 
>_“Then suddenly Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame that ran down swifter than Balrogs from Thangorodrim, and poured over all the plain; and the Mountains of Iron belched forth fires of many poisonous hues, and the fume of them stank upon the air, and was deadly. Thus Ard-galen perished, and fire devoured its grasses; and it became a burned and desolate waste, full of a choking dust, barren and lifeless. Thereafter its name was changed, and it was called Anfauglith, the Gasping Dust.”_

#### Fallen statue, old walls, statue, giant fallen statue head
>_“The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of Mordor used.”_

Air so stagnant, so filled with the miasma of toadstools and rotting leaf mould, that it is dangerous to breathe in. 

* Creatures moving through the fume are considered Poisoned while in it, and for 1d6 rounds after they leave the fume.

#### Puddles, slimy floor, slippery floor

Whether the rock floor is polished to a shine by centuries of water flow, or still runs wet with muddy condensation, movement is difficult in this part of the cavern.

* If combat comes within 10 feet of a rotten tree, there is a 1 in 6 chance each round that it will fall, showering everyone within a 10-foot radius of the trunk with heavy branches or the trunk itself. Creatures within this radius suffer 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.

#### Scattered rocks, moorland heather, small streams

Uncertain and uneven footing, dense plants that obscure the ground, and small rivulets crossing the scene of a battle can all present challenges.

* These count as difficult terrain (half move through the area).

#### Sloping terrain 

A simple incline to the battlefield provides a tactical consideration as well as making the world feel a bit less like a flat battle map. Whether it’s part of a rolling grassy hill, a tussocked ridge, a stony promontory, a huge cavern with its own landscape, a tight pothole steeply angled into the ground, or upwardly winding passages, a slope might affect the whole battlefield or just a part of it. Different slopes might occur in different directions.

* A shallow slope provides creatures on the higher ground with Advantage on attack rolls.

* A steep slope additionally inflicts Disadvantage on attack rolls to creatures on the lower ground.

Tallgrass Prarie grass is covered in grasses that are between 5 - 10 feet tallk.  

* Ranged attacks through a Tallgrass are made at Disadvantage, even at close range. Long range
attacks cannot be made through a thicket. 

* TODO:  Add something about Line of Sight being reduced.


#### Terrible stench, the scent of death 

* Creatures considered good who are affected have Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls.

#### Thick trunked trees 

Thick trunked trees provide excellent cover and their twisted root masses can provide hiding places for the stealthy. 

* These can provide total cover – a creature behind a thick trunked tree cannot be targeted.

* Creatures can hide behind or within the branches or roots of a thick trunked tree.

#### Thick fog, smoke, eerie mist

* Creatures trying to navigate their way through these atmospheric conditions are considered to have the Blinded condition.

#### Thicket 

Close-growing stands of trees, a thicket is typically dominated by birch or hawthorn, or younger trees like larch or elm. 

* Ranged attacks through a thicket are made at Disadvantage, even at close range. Long range
attacks cannot be made through a thicket. 

* This counts as difficult terrain (half move through the thicket).

#### Unstable stalactites 

Grown slowly in the dark over thousands of years, these stalactites are fractured and ready to collapse. 

* If combat comes within 10 feet of the unstable stalactites, there is a 1 in 6 chance each round that they will fall, showering everyone within a 10-foot radius with pieces of rock. Creatures within this radius suffer 5 (1d10) bludgeoning damage.

#### Unstable walls

Long years and the passing seasons have taken their toll on this once fine stonework. It is ready to topple at any moment. 

* Unstable walls provide half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws). 

* These unstable structures are unsuitable for climbing.  

* A shove action allows a creature to push the wall onto other creatures on the other side. They must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage from falling masonry.

#### Warm golden sun, slanting rays of golden light, the sun breaks through the clouds 

Creatures considered good are heartened by the appearance of the sun. 

* They gain Advantage on ability checks and attack rolls the next round, and Inspiration.

#### Webs

Great limp curtains of ancient Spider webs hang in the air in the silent depths of Mirkwood.

* Any creature crossing the webs must make a DC 12 Dexterity or Strength check. If they fail, they are considered Grappled every round until they can make the same check successfully, at which point they may exit the web on any side.

#### Windowed walls 

The remains of a wall may contain many small windows or a single large aperture. 

* Windowed walls provide half cover (+2 to AC and Dexterity saving throws). 

* These unstable structures are unsuitable for climbing.

#### Grasslands

There are 5 basic grassland types.  Here is a basic description of each type.

* Tallgrass (true) prairie - A hex with this grass will naturally grow up to 10 feet tall.  If a given height is needed, roll 1d6+4 for the local height.  This sort of grassland is considered difficult. This grassland will generally be home to grazing animals and the creatures that prey upon them.  They will spend most of their time hiding in the grass.
* Shortgrass prairie - A hex with this grass will naturally grow up to 18 inches.  If a given height is needed roll a 3d6 to find the number of inches.  This sort of grassland is considered a normal grassland.  These grasslands are generally the first areas settled by civilization.  Additionally these graasslands will be grazed by creatures in large herds that can protect themselves from prey with their numbers.
* Mixed-grass prairie - A hex with this grass will be a combination of Short and Tall Grass praries.  For heights see Tall and Short Grass.  This sort of grassland is considered difficult.
* Annual grassland - A Hex with this grass will grow simularly to the Shortgrass Prarie, but it will die in the winter and need to be reseeded again in the spring.  By the end of summer this grass will have become brown and have died off.
* High mountain grassland - A hex with this grass will grow at high elevations generally above 7000 feet.  These grasslands are generally in valleys and on the sloaps of the mountains facing away from the sun (south facing in the northern hemisphere, north facing in the southern hemisphere).  They are 2d6 inches in height.  

Names for Grasslands managed by intelligent species: Farmland, Cultivation, Grazing Lands, Pastures, 

Names for untouched Grasslands: Plain(256), Prairie(128), Savanna(64), Shrubs(32), Steppe(16), Field(8), Range(4), Veldt(2), Swarth (1)

#### Artic 
Snow Fields, Ice Plains, Glaciers


Glacial, Artic/Antartic, Polar, Icy Wastes, Ice-coverd, Ice Plains, Drifts

#### Desert
Cactus, Bad Lands, Steppe, Sand Dunes, 

* Desert (arid) grassland - Shrubs will not grow here, but tufts of hearty grasses will grow.  This grass is sparce and simular in nature to the annual and shortgrass found in prairies.  

* Shrub steppe - Shrubs and grasses will grow here. The grass is sparce and simular in nature to the annual and shortgrass found in prairies. See the description of the shrubs in the seciton on forests.

#### Mountains
Broken Lands, Rock Faces, Snowcaps, 

### Terrain features
A given hex may contain certai features that are in addition to the 

#### Trails
A trail is usually a path, track, lane, road, footpath, walking trail, cattle trail, or game trail that is commonly usesd to facilitate easier travel through the wilderness.  

#### Roads
A road is an imporved and manytimes paved or cobbled trail.  These improvements make travel extremely easy regardless of the wilderness the road is going through.  

#### Forest

A forest is a large area dominated by trees. There are more precise definitions of forest that take into account factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, and ecological function.  There is no standard forest.  A tree dominated region could be any one of the following:

* Broeal forests

* Tropical / subtropical moist forest
* Tropical / subtropical dry forests
* Sparse trees, savanna and shrublands

* Temperate needleleaf forests
* Temperate broadleaf foests*
* Temperate Mixed forests

TODO: Cover Ground Cover in each type of forest.

*Broeal forests* occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.
* *Temperate needleleaf forests* mostly occupy the higher latitude regions, as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable soils. These forests are composed entirely of various pines.

*Tropical forests and subtropical forests* include tropical and subtropical moist forests, tropical and subtropical dry forests, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.
* *Tropical moist forest* have many varities.  The lowland evergreen broad leaf tropical rainforests.  The  peat swamp forests.  There are also high altitude forests in moutains along the equator.  The best description for these is either swamp or jungle.  Typically these range from the rainforest zone 10 degrees north or south of the equator, to the heighest and lowest points the sun will move north and south during the seasons. 
* *Tropical dry forests* are characteristic of areas in the tropics affected by seasonal drought. The seasonality of rainfall is usually reflected in the deciduousness of the forest canopy, with most trees being leafless for several months of the year. However, under some conditions the proportion of evergreen species increases.  Some forests called thorn forest are characterized by dense low stature thorny or spiny species trees and plants.  These are found where drought is prolonged, and especially where grazing animals are plentiful.  Eventually as the quality of the soil gets worse through overgrazing or fires, a savanna develops. 
* *Sparse trees, savanna and shrublands* are forests with lower canopy cover of trees. They occur principally in areas of transition from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in Trpical dry forests.  A savanna is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of grasses. Savannas maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.  shrubs have persistent woody stems above the ground, and they are distinguished from trees by their multiple stems and shorter height.  They can grow to 3d6 feet in height.  Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions.

*Temperate forests* support both broadleaf deciduous forests and evergreen coniferous forests. Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including laurel forests.
* *Temperate needleleaf forests* mostly occupy the higher latitude regions, as well as high altitude zones and some warm temperate areas, especially on nutrient-poor or otherwise unfavourable soils. These forests are composed entirely of various pines.
* *Temperate broadleaf foests* include a substantial component of flowering boradleaf trees. They are generally characteristic of the warmer temperate latitudes, but can sometimes be found in cool temperate ones. They include such forest types as the mixed broadleaf deciduous forests.
* *Temperate Mixed forests* include a substantial component of flowering boradleaf trees in addition to various pines.  These forests typically border the transitiion between needleleaf and broadleaf forests.

#### Swamps
A swamp is a wetland that is forested.  Many swamps occur along large rivers where they are critically dependent upon natural water level fluctuations.   Other swamps occur on the shores of large lakes.  Some swamps have dry-land protrusions called hammocks that are covered by aquatic vegetation or vegetation that tolerates periodic flooding. The water of a swamp may be fresh water, brackish water or seawater. 

*The True Swamp* is a swamp that is populated with forest trees.  This is a combination of a river, coastland, or lake with a Broeal, Tropical (Moist or Dry) Forests, or a Temperate Forest.

*The Transitional Swamp* is a swamp that is populated with shrub swamps. This is a combination of a river, coastland, or lake with a Savanna / Shrublands Forest.

## Stellar Scale
In Fantasy Role Playing Games it can not always be assumed that there is a Stellar scale.  When at this scale, the goal isn't to provide a map to allow travelers on the surface of the land mass a means of navigation.  Instead it is to provide an overview of what the landmass looks like from space.  



### Flat


### Spherical

#### Distance to the horizon
Based on the following formula. 

$$
d = \sqrt{h\times(2 \times R+h)} 
$$

where 

d = distance to the horizon

h = height of the observer above sea level = 6 feet

R = radius of the Earth = 20,900,000 feet

$$
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{6\times(2 \times 20,900,000+6)}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{6 \times 41,800,006}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = \sqrt{250,800,036}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 15,836.6674525 \text{ feet}
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 15,836.6674525 \text{ feet} \times \frac{1\text{ mile}}{5280\text{ feet}}
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 2.99936883569 \text{ miles} 
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
\text{round}(d)= \lceil d-\frac{1}{2} \rceil
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
\text{round}(2.99936883569)= \lceil 2.99936883569-\frac{1}{2} \rceil
\\
\\
\therefore
\\
\\
d = 2.99936883569  \approx 3 \text{ miles} 
\\
\therefore
