So I copied my entire iTunes music library to my iBook today.&#160; I had to leave my podcasts and my audible subscriptions and audio books on the PC as they took up about 20gb.&#160; After everything was transfered I installed [Tangerine](http://www.potionfactory.com/tangerine/)&#160;and pointed it at my iTunes collection.&#160; The program takes a look at each song and figures out the beats per minute and the intensity of each beat.&#160; It will then allow you to put together playlists based on the tempo of the music.&#160; So if you are in a mellow mood you can have it pick all slow songs.&#160; If you are racing around with your head in your hands trying to get everything done, crank the BPM up to above 130.&#160; This application is very cool, and I hope that Apple will fold this functionality into iTunes in the future.&#160; Additionally, I hope someone comes out with a decent version for the PC.&#160; I tried several Windows applicaitons that were like Tangerine, but none of them could compare.

On the technical side.&#160; Transfering Music from PC to Macintosh isn’t all that hard if you have a shared hard drive.&#160; The problems arise becuase iTunes uses an XML file to store information about the music such as Rating (5 Starts), BMP.&#160; So there is no easy way to get the songs that I have analyized on the Apple back to my PC without first spending some quality time making sure that the XML file will be easily transfered.&#160; Part of this transfer is the need to deal with the location the actual files are stored at.&#160; Interestingly enough the XML file generated by iTunes to stores file locations as URLs.&#160; So on my PC the location is [file://localhost/E:/iTunes/](/iTunes/) while on the Macintosh it’s something along the lines of [file://MUSIC/iTunes/](//MUSIC/iTunes/)&#160; Searching and replacing these shouldn’t be all that hard, but I didn’t plan on it when I made the transfer today.&#160; Also to completly analyize my collection of will take something like 2 days.&#160; To be honest this isn’t so bad, as I have over 22 days worth of music.&#160;&#160;I’m looking forward to finding out what the loudest fastest song in my library is; my guess is that it’s some hard core germanic electronic club music that I play when I’m in the “I’m coding go away Mode.”&#160;
