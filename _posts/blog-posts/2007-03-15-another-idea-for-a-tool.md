I want a tool that allows me to import into the following:

  * Google Bookmarks
  * Browser Favorites / Bookmarks
  * Del.icio.us

The Applicaiton should take as an input:

  * RSS
  * OMPL

The above files should use extensions to handle categories or tags.

What Iâ€™m going to build here is a tool that will sync up a list of postings.&#160; I currently have things in my RSS reader, my Google Bookmakrs, my browser favorites, and my Del.icio.us links.

I guess the idea here is that RSS / RDF / OMPL RSS and OMPL are really good transports for the metadata assoicated with a given webpage.&#160; We should be able to get information in and out of each of tools that are used to create these links.

&#160;
