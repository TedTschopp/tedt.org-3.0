I found an article today on [Digg](http://digg.com/software/Forget_1000_monkeys_could_a_PC_write_Shakespeare)&#160;about computers writing stories.&#160; While I do think this is possible, I have yet to hear anyone getting close.&#160; [Music](http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/cope/mp3page.htm) has been done, and done so well that it’s causing people in to rethink what creativity means.

Anyway, this is being posted so I don’t have to hunt down the paper again, and I can read it when I have time to think about it.
