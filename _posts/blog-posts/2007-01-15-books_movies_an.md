I finished reading [Children of Men](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307279901/wwwtschoppnet-20)&nbsp;this weekend.&nbsp; The book is a social commentary on Sex, Family, Love, Hope, and Religion.&nbsp; With this being said, it is a very honest and open look at issues man has surrounding these important dynamics in our lives.&nbsp; In many cases I found it sad.&nbsp;This&nbsp;as the desired effect as the book is a dystopia.&nbsp; The book itself ends on an up note, but everything is not all happy as there is a warning wrapped in it.

I think the book will be one of the top 5 to 10 books I&rsquo;ve read in my lifetime.

Also this weekend, I went and saw the movie [Children of Men](http://www.childrenofmen.net/).&nbsp; What was most fascinating about the movie is what has changed.&nbsp; The most vivid example of the difference between the books and movie is that Luke in the books is a white Episcopalian Priest with epilepsy.&nbsp; In the movies he is a black terrorist who is second in command of the Fishes.&nbsp; Another example of the differences is the movie starts around chapter 20 of a book with only 32 chapters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall the themes of the movie are Hope, Politics, Justice, and Freedom.&nbsp; Missing are all the themes of Family, Sexuality, and Love.&nbsp; 

Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think the movie is good, but it suffers from the politics of the five sceenplay writers.&nbsp; Also the movie has some of the strongest documentry style scenes I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a movie.&nbsp; One sequence near the end of the movie is amazing when you think it&rsquo;s all one continous shot.

Of course as always I could spend many hours blabbering on about both works of art.&nbsp; But I think I&rsquo;ll end with the Psalm that the author used as the title of the book.&nbsp; It should be noted that his Psalm is a written by Moses.

[Psalm 90](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PS%2090;&version=9;)   
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.&nbsp; Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.&nbsp; Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
