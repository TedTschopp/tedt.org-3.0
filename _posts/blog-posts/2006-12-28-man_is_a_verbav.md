Last night I was listening to a radio program that a former pastor of mine is featured on and they brought up the fact that man is a “word-eater.”  I don’t know about the rest of you, but I know that I look forward to reading large books and thinking about the thoughts of others communicated via words.

There are of course all sorts of ways that you can head away from this, but I think I’m going to take it this way:

What are your words and story?  What are your customs and practices that make you unique?  What symbols would you use to represent each of these customs and stories?  And finally regarding the group you most identify with:  Who are we?  Where are we?  What time is it? What is wrong? What is the solution?
