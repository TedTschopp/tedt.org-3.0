I have always thought that the logical direction for chat and email was the same.&#160; At some point in the future the only difference between them will be if you are there to answer the chat.&#160; Looks like Google gets this as well.&#160; 

Email, chat, etc&#8230; is just communications.&#160; So how do you break down those communications.&#160; There is a sender and a reciever and a payload.&#160; The sender can set an importance and a responsiveness factor to the payload.&#160; Then the&#160; reciever can also set an importance and a responsiveness factor based on either the sender or the contents of the payload.&#160; In the end, the whole converstaion be it email, chat, voice communications, static web content, etc&#8230;&#160; should be saved in one space.&#160; It's good to see Google start to get this. 

And why stop at email and chat?&#160; I can see all communications which need human points of contact using a universal interface.
