I am at a dangerous point in blogging.&#160; I have 212 different RSS feeds / blogs that I read.&#160; I know [others](http://scobleizer.com/2007/01/03/25000-items-read-on-google-reader/) manage a whole lot more but I’m not as good as they are.&#160;&#160;At one point back in 2000 or so I had only one feed that I subscribed to via the My Netscape Portal.&#160; It was the news feed from the site I use to run, at [www.theonering.com](http://www.theonering.com)&#160;(they no longer syndicate their news sadly).&#160; Over the last 7 years or so, the number of feeds I read has increased.&#160; &#160;It is now at the point where it takes an hour to read everything each day.&#160; I am now starting to run into a barrier of having too many feeds and I need to change something.&#160; I am running into several problems.&#160; 

The first is that I am still looking for a taxonomy to manage all my feeds.&#160; As I scale up to this level, I am starting to run into the problem that I can’t exactly map everything into nice inboxes.&#160; The second problem that I’m now facing is that not everything that I save maps into nice outboxes either.&#160; The best tool to manage this so far has been [FeedDemon](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/).&#160; Their folder structure for feeds,&#160;watches and news bins makes sense, but I&#160;am at the breaking point as the [GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)esque “[workflow](http://www.flickr.com/photos/koolpal/8872490/in/photostream/)” that I have setup is needing to be reworked.&#160; The only way I can see reworking it is to make sub categories under each of my meta categories.&#160; To be honest, I think that FeedDemon will work just fine doing these things, but my overall workflow will need to change.

The second problem is that I am starting to run into the problem of never being able to be caught up on my reading.&#160; I have now gotten into the habit of scanning articles, but I have found that this misses items.&#160; There have been two solutions to this.&#160; I have started to subscribe to [linkblogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog).&#160; I wish more people would establish linkblogs and publish them.&#160; These linkblogs are great as they allow me to see if there is anything “important” that I missed on my trip through the other blogs.&#160; The other way I am managing this overload is that FeedDemon supports watches which is an automated way to collect information.&#160; I think that over the coming months I will be expanding these watches to be more detailed and specific.&#160; As this happens, I will need to subscribe to more generic feeds to feed these specific watches.&#160; This of course is a force feedback loop that will increase complexity.

My final problem is that I have tried many of the applications out there for reading feeds and I’m starting to approach the breaking point of these applications.&#160; I will keep posting over the coming months regarding how I am managing this, but I suspect that I will find a couple opportunities for improvement on the RSS reader side.
