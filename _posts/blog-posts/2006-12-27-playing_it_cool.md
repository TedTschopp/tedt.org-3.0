So I copied my entire iTunes music library to my iBook today.&nbsp; I had to leave my podcasts and my audible subscriptions and audio books on the PC as they took up about 20gb.&nbsp; After everything was transfered I installed [Tangerine](http://www.potionfactory.com/tangerine/)&nbsp;and pointed it at my iTunes collection.&nbsp; The program takes a look at each song and figures out the beats per minute and the intensity of each beat.&nbsp; It will then allow you to put together playlists based on the tempo of the music.&nbsp; So if you are in a mellow mood you can have it pick all slow songs.&nbsp; If you are racing around with your head in your hands trying to get everything done, crank the BPM up to above 130.&nbsp; This application is very cool, and I hope that Apple will fold this functionality into iTunes in the future.&nbsp; Additionally, I hope someone comes out with a decent version for the PC.&nbsp; I tried several Windows applicaitons that were like Tangerine, but none of them could compare.

On the technical side.&nbsp; Transfering Music from PC to Macintosh isn&rsquo;t all that hard if you have a shared hard drive.&nbsp; The problems arise becuase iTunes uses an XML file to store information about the music such as Rating (5 Starts), BMP.&nbsp; So there is no easy way to get the songs that I have analyized on the Apple back to my PC without first spending some quality time making sure that the XML file will be easily transfered.&nbsp; Part of this transfer is the need to deal with the location the actual files are stored at.&nbsp; Interestingly enough the XML file generated by iTunes to stores file locations as URLs.&nbsp; So on my PC the location is [file://localhost/E:/iTunes/](/iTunes/) while on the Macintosh it&rsquo;s something along the lines of [file://MUSIC/iTunes/](//MUSIC/iTunes/)&nbsp; Searching and replacing these shouldn&rsquo;t be all that hard, but I didn&rsquo;t plan on it when I made the transfer today.&nbsp; Also to completly analyize my collection of will take something like 2 days.&nbsp; To be honest this isn&rsquo;t so bad, as I have over 22 days worth of music.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m looking forward to finding out what the loudest fastest song in my library is; my guess is that it&rsquo;s some hard core germanic electronic club music that I play when I&rsquo;m in the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coding go away Mode.&rdquo;&nbsp;
