Ok, more stuff to post on my calendar [App](http://www.tedt.org/2006/04/07/a_little_calend/).&#160; I've gotten the ical file loaded into the webpage, now I need to convert the ical file into a usable data type.&#160; My current thoughts are to go from i-Cal -> XML.&#160; I need to spend some time looking at the practices of converting from i-Cal -> XML.&#160; I notice that Google is doing it.&#160; Also the Microformat guys seem to be doing it as well.
