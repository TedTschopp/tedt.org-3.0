What is love?  What does it mean to love someone?  Do you truly love the people in your life?  This book will make you examine questions like these and force you to places of greater certainty in your answers.  

&quot;Holy places are dark places. It is life and strength, not knowledge and words, that we get in them. Holy wisdom is not clear and thin like water, but thick and dark like blood.&quot;
